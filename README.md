# The eduPerson Schema for Apache DS
While trying to set up a test directory for use in SAML testing, I found that the eduPerson schema was not translated into the ApacheDS format.

After having to translate the schema from the OpenLDAP format that was provided by REFEDS [here](https://wiki.refeds.org/display/STAN/eduPerson) I figured I should make it available to others that might want it.
